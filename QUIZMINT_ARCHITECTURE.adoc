= SPEC-001: Quizmint – AI-Powered Study Material Generator
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

Students often rely on textbooks and notes in PDF format to prepare for exams. However, extracting key concepts and testing oneself requires significant time and effort. This application aims to automate the generation of study cards and practice questions using AI, based on PDF documents uploaded by the user. The tool will personalize difficulty based on student age and preferred challenge level. This will allow efficient and personalized learning, and sessions can be saved for future continuation.

== Requirements

The system must fulfill the following functional and non-functional requirements. These are organized using the MoSCoW prioritization framework.

=== Must Have
- Run on Mac, PC, Linux, Chromebook, iOS, Android
- Use only completely free tools and libraries
- Perform quickly and efficiently (low latency)
- Capture user's age during signup
- Upload 1 PDF document for free users; multiple for paid users
- Generate up to 10 study cards from document(s) for free users; unlimited for paid users
  - User selects subject(s) or entire document as source
  - Study cards tailored by age and difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
- Generate up to 10 MCQs for free users; unlimited for paid users
  - User selects subject(s) or entire document as source
  - Questions tailored by age and difficulty level
  - System auto-grades and tracks progress
- Free users can save one session
- Paid users can save multiple sessions

=== Should Have
- Ability to review saved study cards and questions later
- Display progress trends (e.g., via simple charts)

=== Could Have
- Offline mode with local session cache
- AI feedback on wrong answers

=== Won’t Have (for MVP)
- Real-time collaboration or multiplayer quizzes
- Handwritten PDF recognition

== Method

=== Assumptions

- The application will be a hybrid app (PWA-first) that works across desktop and mobile platforms.
- Backend logic and AI integration will be built using Firebase Functions (serverless).
- Firebase Firestore will be used for storing users, sessions, and progress data.
- Free-tier AI APIs (e.g., HuggingFace Inference API) will generate questions and study cards.
- Output types: Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) and Fill-in-the-Blank questions.

@startuml
actor User
User -> Frontend : Upload PDF + Choose Settings
Frontend -> Firebase Storage : Upload PDF File
Frontend -> Firestore : Save metadata (user, age, subject, difficulty)

=== Components

1. **Frontend (React + PWA)**
   - Upload PDF, select difficulty, subject, question type
   - Display generated study materials
   - Save/restore study sessions
   - Track progress

2. **Firebase Functions**
   - Triggered by new session metadata
   - Extract text from PDF (using `pdf-parse`)
   - Call HuggingFace API (or similar) to generate MCQs / Fill-in-the-blank
   - Save questions into Firestore

3. **Firestore Schema**
```json
// Users Collection
{
  "userId": {
    "age": 13,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "subscription": "free"
  }
}

// Sessions Collection
{
  "sessionId": {
    "userId": "userId",
    "pdfUrl": "...",
    "createdAt": "...",
    "subject": "Science",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "type": "mcq",
    "questions": [
      {
        "type": "mcq",
        "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
        "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
        "answer": "A"
      }
    ],
    "progress": {
      "answered": 3,
      "correct": 2
    }
}
```

== Implementation

=== 1. Project Setup
- Initialize GitHub repository
- Create React + Vite project
- Set up Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- Install and configure `vite-plugin-pwa`
- Set up routing using `react-router-dom`

=== 2. Firebase Integration

- Enable Firestore, Auth, Storage, and Functions
- Connect Firebase SDK to frontend
- Set up Firebase Hosting (optional for PWA deployment)

=== 3. User Authentication
- Implement signup form (capture email, password, age)
- Implement login and logout
- Store user data (including age and subscription) in Firestore
- Support Google OAuth as a sign-in option

=== 4. PDF Upload
- Create PDF upload UI (limit 1 for free users)
- Upload PDF to Firebase Storage
- Create session metadata doc in Firestore (trigger backend)

=== 5. Backend AI Processing
- Write Firebase Function to trigger on new session
- Download PDF from Storage and extract text (using `pdf-parse`)
- Call free AI API (e.g., HuggingFace) to generate MCQs and fill-in-the-blank
- Save questions into Firestore under the session document

=== 6. Study Session UI
- Build UI to view and answer study questions
- Support both MCQ and fill-in-the-blank formats
- Add difficulty level and subject filters
- Save answers and track progress (correct/incorrect, score)
